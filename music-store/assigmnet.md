Assignment:
1. Add images for every album (you have already done for artists) from the previous music store assignment.

2. Also add a custom validator to the album release_date field that restricts the valid years to be between 1800 and the current year. DO NOT HARDCODE THE CURRENT YEAR. Use timezone.now().year to get the current year. Also use a BUILT-IN  validator to make sure the artist name field has a minimum length of 2.

3. Create a detail view for albums (you have already done for artists)
The album detail view should show the albumâ€™s artist, title, release_date and cover_image.
